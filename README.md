# Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome 
## I'm Hamza Y.

Hi, Iâ€™m Hamza Yaseen â€” a Computer Science student with a deep interest in coding, AI, machine learning, and backend development.
I enjoy building real-world tech solutions that solve problems, automate tasks, or simply make things better. From experimenting with Python and machine learning models to developing APIs with Node.js and Express, Iâ€™m always eager to explore, learn, and create.

I believe in consistent growth and sharing what I learn along the way â€” whether it's through projects, posts, or collaboration.

Letâ€™s connect and build something meaningful!
